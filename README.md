# Star Wars Characters

## About

This project is based on Setve Kinney's [React State](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/pure-react-state/) course for Frontend Masters (original repo [here](https://github.com/stevekinney/star-wars-characters-react-state)). The project in this repository is a working adaptation that fetches data from the current version of [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/), using custom Hooks to manage the state of the app and a completely custom made UI by me.

Check the live version [here!](https://swchars.web.app/)
